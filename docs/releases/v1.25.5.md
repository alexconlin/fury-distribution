Welcome to KFD release `v1.25.5`.

The distribution is maintained with ❤️ by the team [SIGHUP](https://sighup.io/) it is battle tested in production environments.

With this release, we did general improvements and bugfixing on the furyctl templates and schemas.

- Fix: `.spec.distribution.modules.logging.minio.storageSize` is now being used
- Fix: `kustomize` command now correctly uses `--load_restrictor LoadRestrictionsNone`
- Fix: tolerations and nodeSelector overrides are now fixed for ingress module
- Fix: tolerations now can use field `operator` that was missing from the schema
